# Store first and last name as variables
first_name = "ian"
last_name = "ONEILL"

# Print greeting with name conversions

# Two decimal numbers
num1 = 12.5
num2 = 3.5

# Performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
addition = num1 + num2
subtraction = num1 - num2
multiplication = num1 * num2
division = num1 / num2

# Print results for each operation
print(str(num1) + " plus " + str(num2) + " equals " + str(addition))
print(str(num1) + " minus " + str(num2) + " equals " + str(subtraction))
print(str(num1) + " times " + str(num2) + " equals " + str(multiplication))
print(str(num1) + " divided by " + str(num2) + " equals " + str(division))
